            <p class="about-sum">In this evocative debut novel, Rebecca Johansen weaves a riveting story of past and
                present.</p>
            <div class="about-det">
                <p>Helen Bryant is twenty-five years old. She feels that her life is on the rise now. She has a great
                    job in
                    New York City and falls in love with a fascinating artist. Her traumatic memories of the past
                    finally
                    begin to disappear. Helen's life broke up almost ten years ago, during an idyllic summer in her
                    family's
                    house on Eagle Lake, when her very old friend blamed her father for rape. During the detention
                    pending
                    trial, Helen insisted on her father's innocence. She tried to avoid meeting the reporters and
                    clinging
                    to the memories about the most adorable man.

                    Now her father is getting out. However, when Helen returns to a closed lakeside house, the details
                    of
                    that fatal night come up: the freeze of the lake, the first love's heat, the frightening bite of
                    jealousy. And as old memories face new realities, they doubt everything she thinks she knows about
                    her
                    family, friends, and, finally, about herself. Now Helen's choice will be tested with life-changing
                    after-effects.<br><br>
